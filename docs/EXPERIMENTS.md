# Experiments

1. **Baseline vs RL** (bridges): rule-based vs PPO under equal budget.
2. **Ablation**: remove traffic feature, adjust reward weights.
3. **Stress tests**: hazard spikes; inspection delay; budget cuts.
4. **Transfer**: train on bridges, finetune to pavements.

Store outputs in `outputs/run_<timestamp>/`.
